# Lab 07: Introduction to Azure IoT Edge

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will learn to set up and configure an IoT Edge virtual machine (VM) to simulate an IoT device on the Azure platform. You will start by configuring the necessary prerequisites, followed by creating and configuring an IoT Edge VM. Then, you'll add an Edge module to the IoT Edge device, including the deployment of a simulated temperature sensor. The final step involves deploying Azure Stream Analytics as an IoT Edge module, which will process the data generated by the simulated sensor locally before sending it to Azure IoT Hub for further analysis and storage. Through these exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience with managing IoT devices, modules, and data analytics using Azure services.

## Lab Scenario

To encourage local consumers in a global marketplace, Contoso has partnered with local artisans to produce cheese in new regions around the globe.

Each location supports multiple production lines that are equipped with the mixing and processing machines that are used to create the local cheeses. Currently, the facilities have IoT devices connected to each machine. These devices stream sensor data to Azure and all data is processed in the cloud.

Due to the large amount of data being collected and the urgent time response needed on some of the machines, Contoso wants to use an IoT Edge gateway device to bring some of the intelligence to the edge for immediate processing. A portion of the data will still be sent to the cloud. Bringing data intelligence to the IoT Edge also ensures that they will be able to process data and react quickly even if the local network is poor.

You have been tasked with prototyping the Azure IoT Edge solution. To begin, you will be setting up an IoT Edge device that monitors temperature (simulating a device connected to one of the cheese processing machines). You will then deploy a Stream Analytics module to the device that will be used to calculate the average temperature and generate an alert notification if process control values are exceeded.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following:

- Exercise 1: Configure Lab Prerequisites
- Exercise 2: Create and configure an IoT Edge VM
- Exercise 3: Add Edge Module to Edge Device
- Exercise 4: Deploy Azure Stream Analytics as IoT Edge Module

## Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

## Exercise 3: Add Edge Module to Edge Device

When a new module instance is created by the IoT Edge runtime, it gets a corresponding module identity. The module identity is stored in IoT Hub, and is used as the addressing and security scope for all local and cloud communications for that module instance. In implementation, modules images exist as container images in a repository, and module instances are containers on devices. The only supported container engine for IoT Edge devices in production is Moby. In this exercise, you will add a Simulated Temperature Sensor as a custom IoT Edge module, and deploy it to run on the IoT Edge Device.

### Task 1: Configure module for deployment

1. At the command prompt, to watch the telemetry being sent from the Edge device by the **tempsensor** module, enter the following command:

      ```bash
      sudo iotedge logs tempsensor
      ```

      > **Note**: If the simulated temperature sensor module stopped before the asa module was deployed, you can restart it by running the `sudo iotedge restart tempsensor` command. Let it run for about 30 seconds and then recheck the logs.

1. Take a minute to observe the output. While watching the temperature telemetry being sent by **tempsensor**, notice that a **reset** command is sent by the Stream Analytics job when the **machine.temperature** reaches an average above **25**. This is the action configured in the Stream Analytics job query. Output of this event will look similar to the following:
